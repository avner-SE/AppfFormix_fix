AppFormix ContainerFlow
=======================

AppFormix ContainerFlow provides resource control and visibility for hosts,
containers, and virtual machines in your cloud infrastructure.

The software consists of multiple components:

* Agent monitors resource usage on compute nodes.
* Controller offers REST APIs to configure the system.
* DataManager stores data from multiple Agents.
* Dashboard provides a Web-based user interface.
* An Adapter discovers platform-specific resources and configures Controller.
  Adapters exist for OpenStack, Kubernetes, Amazon EC2.

The Agent component runs on the lowest level "compute nodes" of the
infrastructure that provide computational resources to execute application
workload. A compute node may be a bare-metal host or a virtual machine.

The remaining components run on a class of "infrastructure node(s)" that
execute the services that power software-defined infrastructure, such as the
OpenStack infrastructure service nodes or Kubernetes master nodes. A host on
which ContainerFlow control plane components is a Controller host (likely a
virtual machine). A Controller host requires network connectivity to all of the
compute nodes and to infrastructure services that manage the infrastructure.

Ansible playbooks are provided to install and uninstall the software on compute
nodes and the Controller host.
