# Uninstall AppFormix and remove all data, configuration, and log files.

# As a safeguard to protect user data, the appformix_openstack.yml playbook
# only uninstalls all services, but does not delete any historical data or
# configuration.  This clean_appformix_standalone.yml playbook will remove
# all associated data used by AppFormix for monitoring.
