  another.  Previously, the timeline recorded the "DELETE" status for the
  old host from which the instance was moved.
* Improve manner in which user project list is requested from OpenStack
  Keystone API.  In some environments, Keystone policy restricted access to

  Previously, chargeback for vCenter used the concept of a chargeback aggregate.
  Chargeback aggregate is now deprecated.
* When creating a report template in Dashboard, choices of metrics for Ceph
  Object Storage (if present) are displayed even if no Cinder backends are
  configured.
* Add custom logo to service availability report.
* Custom logo in reports displays with original aspect ratio of the image.
* In Dashboard, option for "Excluded Project Domain" only filters projects
  from the navigation menu.  Projects remain visible in the properties of

  cpu.normalized_loadavg_15m.  The metrics are a ratio of Linux load
  average to effective CPU cores.  Previously, the units displayed "%".

  settings.
* Fix issue in Dashboard chart that charts did not update after changing

  type. In the report, a single chart for a selected metric displays a
  line for each storage backend type.
* Add capability to override the endpoint URLs for Heat and Glance.
* Improve Contrail service heartbeat alert to generate an event if a
  service fails when the alert is already active for a different service
  heartbeat failure.  All failed services are included in the metadata
  of the alert.
* Fix an issue that Ceph monitoring may not be configured in Agent for a
  hyperconverged host that also provides compute (e.g., an OpenStack nova
  hypervisor).


v2.15.0
=======
* NOTE TO USERS: MongoDB version changed from 3.0.6 to 3.2.17.  Users MUST
  upgrade to v2.15 before upgrading to a version later than v2.15.
* In Dashboard, add capability to generate a Capacity Report that shows
  resource allocation over time.  User defines a report template that
  specifies what metrics to display in the report.  The report template is
  used to generate a report for a user-specified period of time.
* In Dashboard, add a volume summary page that displays volume storage
  allocations by storage backend type and volume type.  User may filter the
  view by project.

  Keystone, Nova, Neutron services.
* Use consistent terminology in Dashboard and reports to distinguish
  resource allocation and consumption.  An allocated resource is a resource
  provisioned by a cloud management platform (e.g., provisioning 4 vCPUs
  for an instance on a host).  A used resource is a resource consumed by an
  entity (e.g., CPU consumption by a virtual machine, storage consumption
  by a volume).
* In Dashboard Plan panel, change the bar graph to display percent allocated
  instead of percent available.
* In Dashboard Plan panel, add informational pop-up to explain how
  allocated percent is calculated.
* In Dashboard, add option to hide Instance Actions.
* In Dashboard, user may filter the list of OpenStack projects that are
  displayed in the context navigation menu to exclude projects that
  belong to a particular domain.  This is useful to filter auto-generated
  projects, such as created by Heat.
* Custom logo configured by user is displayed in header of Capacity Report.
* In Chargeback, add capability to specify a one-time fee to the "OS
  License" rate card.  Use of a particular image by an instance now has two
  cost components: (1) an hourly rate, and (2) a one-time cost for creating
  an instance that uses the image.  Each cost may be set independently.
* Plugins for OpenStack service monitoring accept parameters to specify the
  location of the API access log files.
* Add JTI support for Junos OS versions 15.1F5, 15.1F6, 15.1F7, 16.1R3,
  17.2R1, and 17.3R1.
* Add support for monitoring hyperconverged host that provides compute and
  Ceph storage.
* Add support to monitor a host using both the Agent on the host and with
  metrics from IPMI.

  an RPM file for installation on CentOS and Red Hat Enterpise Linux.  Both
  the RPM file and Python wheels package are included in the release bundle
  in the 'pkg' subdirectory.
* AppFormix Stream API provides push-based stream of events to a client.
  Client may configure AppFormix to listen to messages from a RabbitMQ, and
  those messages will be published on the AppFormix Stream.

  to the original object chart after sometime. Earlier this required an
  additional refresh.
* Fix issue wherein contrail virtual network status was not getting updated by
  the discovery adapter

  are no longer present.  All logs are written to appformix_manager.log.

* Fix issue in volume discovery when host attributes are not populated in
  the Cinder definition of the volume.


v1.9.1
======
* Capacity Planning panel displays all of the Flavor series on the charts,
  by default.  Previously, only 10 flavors were displayed by default, and
  as a result, it could appear that the charts were incorrect.
* Capacity data is collected every 10 minutes instead of every 1 day.
* Add cleanup_appformix_openstack.yml playbook to uninstall and remove all
  log files, configuration files, and MongoDB data.

* User may now configure multiple MySQL databases to be monitored.  An
  Alarm may be configured for any or all of the databases or cluster nodes.
* Add API to modify display name of a RabbitMQ or MySQL cluster.

* Change name of disk.usage metric to disk.usage.percent.


v1.6.4
======
* Fix issue with disk usage metric always reporting zero.

  restarts. This handles uncommon cases when simultaneous configuration
  requests are made for the same entity.


v1.6.3
======
* Agent reports disk usage metrics for NVM Express (NVMe) storage drives.
* Fix Alarm creation panel in Dashboard to provide proper scope selection for
  RabbitMQ and MySQL services.

  been required, but now the playbook installs for the user.
* The appformix_openstack.yml Ansible playbook performs Docker login to
  authenticate with the AppFormix Docker Registry.
* Change default configuration of Controller and OpenStack Adapter to use
  IP address of the controller host, instead of hostnames that may not be

  container when there is a change to the container parameters.


v1.6.0
======
* The appformix_openstack.yml Ansible playbook uses OpenStack environment
  variables (e.g., from an openrc file) to configure AppFormix OpenStack
  Adapter.  Installation and configuration is now fully automated without
  entering configuration values in the Dashboard.
* Installation pulls Docker images from registry.appformix.com.  Prior to
  running the appformix_openstack.yml playbook, user must first
  authenticate using "docker login registry.appformix.com".
* Dashboard client accesses all AppFormix services over a single port.
  This change makes it easier to configure networking via a proxy or
  load-balancer because the Dashboard client performs all communication
  over the host and port specified in the URL supplied to the browser.
* Add ability to configure nightly backup of MongoDB used by AppFormix.
  User can restore from a backup file by passing additional argument to
  the appformix_openstack.yml playbook.
* License file is now required during installation.  The license file is
  passed as an argument to appformix_openstack.yml playbook.

  * Host memory page_in_out rate
* Add a new HeatMap view in the Dashboard that displays a graphical
  overview of all hosts and instances and the resource consumption by each.

v1.5.8
======
* User can configure which Keystone roles will see Admin View in the Dashboard.


v1.5.6
======

* Resolve nginx "readv() denied" on a UNIX domain socket on Linux 3.16.
  This release includes a workaround for a known issue in the Linux 3.1.6
  kernel.  For understanding of the kernel issue, refer to:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/1446906.
* Single Ansible playbook (appformix_openstack.yml) deploys AppFormix.
  Previously, there were separate playbooks for controller and compute.
* Ansible playbooks and roles work with Ansible 1.9.3 and docker-py 1.3.1.
