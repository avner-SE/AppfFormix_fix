# AppFormix controller host
#
# Host variables can be defined to control AppFormix configuration parameters
# for particular host.  For example, to specify the directory in which MongoDB
# data is stored on hostname1 (the default is /opt/appformix/mongo/data):
#
#   hostname1 appformix_mongo_data_dir=/var/lib/appformix/mongo
#
# For variables with same value for all AppFormix controller hosts, set group
# variables below.

# Configuration variables for all hosts in the appformix_controller group.
# Enter one variable per line.  Examples:
#
#   appformix_docker_user=username
#   appformix_docker_email=youremail@yourcompany.com
#   appformix_docker_password=password
#   appformix_license=license_file.sig

# Worker nodes are passive nodes fronted by appformix_load_balancer or

# as source=bare-metal. Agent would then discover all the instances running on
# that bare host.
#
# Add "appformix_kvm_instance_discovery='true'" if you want automatic
